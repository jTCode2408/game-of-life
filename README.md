# game-of-life
 * Conway's Game Of Life coded in ReactJs *
 
## Research:

## About the game:
* Created by John Conway, a British mathmetician, in 1970.
* Zero player game, that evolves by state without needing further input from players.

* Turing complete, can simulate any turing machine

# Relation to Turing Completeness:

# Why itâ€™s useful:


# Rules:
* Any LIVE cell with 2 OR 3 live neighbors, lives to next generation. 
* Any DEAD cell with 3 live neighbors, becomes alive in next generation.
* All other live cells become DEAD in next generation, and dead cells STAY dead.
